Someday, long ago this thing was created to be the best game that ever was.  
It wasn't.

It was supposed to win the Imagine Cup competition.  
It didn't.

It was supposed to be fun.  
To be honest, it pretty much wasn't.

Oh and the code is a one big blob of spaghetti and a result of shitty teamwork, working overnight, huge amounts of stress and me trying to be the team leader/graphic designer/game designer/developer at once because the *supposed* 5-man team was actually quite a bit smaller.

But hey we had some fun, we tried. I learned very well how much of a bullshit teamwork can be when some people just ain't feeling it. And that forcing them through ain't going to work. Even with given tasks, guides, help materials, meetings and so on. It was also our very first try at something bigger than a snake game and with Unity as an engine :dog:. 

Still, it was worth it to aim for the skies and try :smiley:. Also, my nostalgia and love-hate relationship with this project forces me to share it. Here you go.
