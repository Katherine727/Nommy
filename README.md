Someday, long ago this thing was created to be the best game that ever was.
It wasn't.
It was supposed to win the Imagine Cup competition.
It didn't.
It was supposed to be fun.
To be honest, it pretty much wasn't.

Oh and the code is a one big blob of spaghetti and a result of shitty teamwork, working overnight, huge amounts of stress and me trying to be the team leader/graphic designer/game designer/developer at once because the **supposed** 5-man team was actually quite a bit smaller.

Huge thanks to the other coder who managed to be a part of the team. Yay.

Good times. Good times...
